2. Program in python to check if two strings are anagram or not.
3. Program in python to count and display vowels in a string.
4. Program in python to find all duplicate characters in string.
5. Program in python to reverse words in a given String in Python.
6. Program to calculate the length of a string
7. Program to count the character frequency in a string
8. Program for a Function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.
9. Program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string
10. Program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.
11. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence
12. Program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string
13. Program that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases
14. Program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form
15. Function to insert a string in the middle of a string
16. Program to sort a string lexicographically
17. Program to remove a newline in Python
18. Program to check whether a string starts with specified characters
19. Program to lowercase first n characters in a string
20. Program to Check Whether a String is Palindrome or Not.
21. Program to Remove Punctuations From a String
22. Program to Sort Words in Alphabetic Order of a string
23. Program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should then print the following:
 
    * The total number of characters in the string
    * The string repeated 10 times
    * The first character of the string (remember that string indices start at 0)
    * The first three characters of the string
    * The last three characters of the string
    * The string backwards
    * The string with its first and last characters removed
    * The string in all caps
    * The string with every a replaced with an e
    * The string with every letter replaced by a space
    
24. Program that, given a string that contains a decimal number, prints out the decimal part of the number. For instance, if given 5.74159, the program should print out .74159
